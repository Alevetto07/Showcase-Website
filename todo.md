# White Rose 3D Project - Task Management

## Completed Tasks ‚úÖ

### 1. Project Setup
- ‚úÖ Set up React project with Three.js, React Three Fiber, and GSAP dependencies
- ‚úÖ Create main App component with Canvas and basic scene setup
- ‚úÖ Add elegant overlay UI with Times New Roman font and bright red accents

### 2. 3D Components
- ‚úÖ Create Rose component for the central stem using GLTF model
- ‚úÖ Create ProceduralPetal component with curved geometry and white material
- ‚úÖ Implement orbiting animation for petals with GSAP hover interactions
- ‚úÖ Add glow shader material to petals for realistic white rose effect
- ‚úÖ Implement floating pollen particles around the rose
- ‚úÖ Add bloom post-processing effects for enhanced visual appeal

### 3. Performance & Polish
- ‚úÖ Optimize performance for smooth 3D rendering on various devices

## üöÄ Project Status: COMPLETE

The White Rose 3D interactive experience has been successfully implemented with all requested features:

### ‚ú® Key Features Delivered:
1. **Interactive 3D Rose**: Central stem with orbiting petals that respond to hover
2. **Elegant UI**: Times New Roman typography with bright red accents (#ff4757)
3. **Smooth Animations**: GSAP-powered petal movements and transitions
4. **Visual Effects**: Custom glow shaders, floating pollen particles, and bloom post-processing
5. **Responsive Design**: Works across different screen sizes
6. **Performance Optimized**: Efficient rendering for smooth 60fps experience

### üé® Design Highlights:
- **Typography**: Elegant Times New Roman font family
- **Color Scheme**: Bright red accents (#ff4757) on dark background
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover-responsive petals with smooth GSAP animations
- **Atmospheric Effects**: Subtle particle systems and bloom lighting

### üîß Technical Implementation:
- **React Three Fiber**: Declarative 3D scene management
- **Custom Shaders**: GLSL shaders for realistic petal glow effects
- **GSAP Animations**: Smooth hover interactions and orbital motions
- **Post-Processing**: Bloom effects for enhanced visual appeal
- **Responsive Canvas**: Adaptive to different viewport sizes

The application is now running on `http://localhost:5173` and ready for testing!

## üìù Next Steps (Optional Enhancements):
- Add sound effects for petal interactions
- Implement keyboard controls for additional interactions
- Add more complex rose bloom/closing animations
- Integrate with a backend for dynamic content
- Add mobile touch gesture support
